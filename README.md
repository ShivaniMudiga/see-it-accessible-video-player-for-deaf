# see-it-accessible-video-player-for-deaf
Chrome extension designed to bridge the accessibility gap in online video content for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. By providing both pre-recorded sign language videos and AI-generated sign language avatars, SignEase ensures that everyone can understand and enjoy video content in their own language.

This prototype is designed to identify video elements within the browser and synchronize a sample video accordingly. However, the sample video could not be included in the Git repository. To ensure the prototype functions as intended, please add a sample video manually.
